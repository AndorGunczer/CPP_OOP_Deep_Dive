# CPP-Exercises

Target: C++ OOP Programming

This Project consists of many subprojects, whose goal is to establish and deepen my knowledge in C++ Object-Oriented Programming Concepts.

The Subprojects aim to develop my skillset in the following areas:

<b>CPP00:</b> Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static/const.

<b>CPP01:</b> C++ style memory allocation, pointers to members, references.

<b>CPP02:</b> AD-Hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form (Constr/Destr/Copy/Overl. Assignment Operator)

<b>CPP03:</b> Inheritance

<b>CPP04:</b> Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces

<b>CPP05:</b> Repetition and Exceptions

<b>CPP06:</b> C++ style Casts

<b>CPP07:</b> C++ Templates

<b>CPP08:</b> Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

<b>CPP09:</b> STL (Standard Template Library), Use Cases of different Custom Data Structures

What's worth looking at the most to my opinion are: CPP08, CPP09, CPP03

<b>How to check the projects:</b>
    </br>1. Each CPPXX is an individual projects of the 42Curriculum
    </br>2. Inside each CPPXX folder, you find Y exercises and the description of the exercises (subject.pdf)
    </br>3. Ideal way to check the exercises is to go into the individual exercise directory, execute "make", run the program while reading the requirements in the subject.pdf
