# CPP-Exercises

Target: C++ OOP Programming

This Project consists of many subprojects, whose goal is to establish and deepen my knowledge in C++ Object-Oriented Programming Concepts.

The Subprojects aim to develop my skillset in the following areas:

CPP00: Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static/const.

CPP01: C++ style memory allocation, pointers to members, references.

CPP02: AD-Hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form (Constr/Destr/Copy/Overl. Assignment Operator)

CPP03: Inheritance

CPP04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces

CPP05: Repetition and Exceptions

CPP06: C++ style Casts

CPP07: C++ Templates

CPP08: Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

CPP09: STL (Standard Template Library), Use Cases of different Custom Data Structures

What's worth looking at the most to my opinion are: CPP08, CPP09, CPP03

How to check the projects:
    1. Each CPPXX is an individual projects of the 42Curriculum
    2. Inside each CPPXX folder, you find Y exercises and the description of the exercises (subject.pdf)
    3. Ideal way to check the exercises is to go into the individual exercise directory, execute "make", run the program while reading the requirements in the subject.pdf
